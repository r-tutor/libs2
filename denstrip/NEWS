USER-VISIBLE CHANGES (for detailed changes see ChangeLog in the source package)
--------------------

Version 1.5.3 (2014-02-20)
--------------------------

o Added arguments "tcol" and "mcol" to denstrip to change the colours
  of tick marks.

o DESCRIPTION file fixed to satisfy CRAN check.


Version 1.5.2 (2012-04-02)
--------------------------

o Fix for densregion with very small numbers of unique densities.

o Package now depends on the new R 2.15 due to the use of
.filled.contour in densregion.

o Default value of 1 added to "max" argument in denstrip.legend,
  fixing the problem revealed by the new R CMD check.


Version 1.5.1 (2011-01-17) 
--------------------------

o "S3Method" corrected to "S3method" in NAMESPACE.


Version 1.5 (2010-05-18)
------------------------

o "colmin" argument added to all functions which accept "colmax".  If
  set to "transparent", this allows multiple density regions or strips
  to be drawn on the same plot with smooth overlaps, as long as the
  graphics device supports transparency.


Version 1.4 (2009-09-24)
------------------------

o panel.denstrip can now be used with the lattice "bwplot" function. 
  See the new example code in help(denstrip).


Version 1.3 (2009-03-23)
------------------------

o Contour lines can now be added to density regions. 

o Point sizes and plotting characters can be varied between "cistrip"
  strips.


Version 1.2 (2008-11-03)
------------------------

o Panel functions for all strips implemented for use with lattice
  graphics.

o Sectioned density plots can now point downwards or rightwards.


Version 1.1 (2008-08-21)
------------------------

o Alpha channel supported in user-specified colours. 

o Eliminated dependency on R.utils, through new function
  seqToIntervals for finding sequences in a vector of integers. 


Version 1.0 (2008-08-15)
------------------------

o New release
