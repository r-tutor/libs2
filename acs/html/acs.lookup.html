<h2> Search for relevant demographic variables and tables from the US
Census.  </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p> The <code>acs.fetch</code> function is used to download data
from the US Census American Community Survey.  The <code>acs.lookup</code>
function provides a convenience function to use in advance to locate
tables and variables that may be of interest.
</p>
<p><code>acs.lookup</code> takes arguments similar to <code>acs.fetch</code> &mdash; in
particular, &quot;table.number&quot;, &quot;table.name&quot;, and &quot;keyword&quot;, as well as
&quot;endyear&quot;,&quot;span&quot;, and &quot;dataset&quot; &mdash; and searches for matches in the
meta-data of the Census tables.  When multiple search terms are passed
to a given argument (e.g., <code>keyword=c("Female", "GED")</code>), the
tool returns matches where ALL of the terms are found; similarly, when
more than one lookup argument is used (e.g.,
<code>table.number="B01001", keyword="Female"</code>), the tool searches for
matches that include all of the terms (i.e., terms are combined with a
logical &quot;AND&quot;, not a logical &quot;OR&quot;).
</p>
<p>Results from acs.lookup &mdash; which are acs.lookup class objects &mdash; can
then be inspected, subsetted (with [square brackets]), and combined
(with <code>c</code> or <code>+</code>) to create custom acs.lookup objects to
store and later pass to <code>acs.fetch</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
acs.lookup(endyear, span = 5, dataset = "acs", keyword,
     table.name, table.number, case.sensitive = T)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>endyear</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer indicating the latest year of the data in
the survey (e.g., for data from the 2007-2011 5-year ACS data,
endyear would be 2011; limited by acceptable values currently
provided by the Census API); for 2016 and later, the 2015 lookup
tables are used (see details).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>span</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer indicating the span (in years) of the desired
ACS data (should be 1, 3, or 5); defaults to 5.  Ignored and reset
to 0 if dataset=&quot;sf1&quot; or &quot;sf3&quot;.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>dataset</code></td>
<td>
<p>either &quot;acs&quot; (the default), &quot;sf1&quot;, or &quot;sf3&quot;, indicating
whether to look for tables and variables in the American Community
Survey, the SF1 dataset (decennial/&quot;short-form&quot;), or the SF3 dataset
(decennial/&quot;long-form&quot;).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>keyword</code></td>
<td>
<p> a string or vector of strings giving the search
term(s) to find in the name of the ACS census variable (for
example, &quot;Male&quot; or &quot;Haiti&quot;); accepts multiple words, which must
all be found in the returned variable names.  </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>table.name</code></td>
<td>
<p>a string giving the search term(s) to find in the
name of the ACS census table (for example, &quot;Sex&quot; or &quot;Age&quot; or &quot;Age
by Sex&quot;); accepts multiple words, which must all be found in the
returned table names.  </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>table.number</code></td>
<td>
<p>a string (not a number) indicating the desired
table from the Census to fetch; examples: &quot;B01003&quot; or &quot;B23013&quot;;
always case-sensitive. Used to identify all variables for a given
table number. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>case.sensitive</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical flag indicating whether searching is
case-sensitive (the default) or not.  Note that the Census is not
entirely consistent in capitalization in table and variable names,
so setting <code>case.sensitive=F</code> may be useful in finding all
possible matches.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In many cases, <code>acs.lookup</code> is called internally by
<code>acs.fetch</code>, to determine the variable codes to use for a given
table.name or table.number.  Since each lookup involves a search of
static XML tables (provided by the census for each endyear/span
combination, and included by the acs package in /extdata), searches
involving more recent years (e.g., for version 2.0, endyears &gt; 2014) may
fail.  In such situations, users may wish to call <code>acs.fetch</code> with
the &quot;variable=&quot; option, perhaps reusing variables from a saved
<code>acs.lookup</code> search for a previous year.
</p>
<p>For example, once the 2011-2015 5-year ACS data is available via the
API, users can attempt the following to access Table B01003, even before
the new version of the package is installed with the correct variable
lookup tables: <code>acs.fetch(endyear=2015, span=5,
  variable=acs.lookup(endyear=2014, span=5, table.number="B01003"))</code>.
</p>
<p>Note: version 2.1.3 of the package implements a &quot;workaround&quot; to address a
problem accessing data from 2016, when the Census Bureau seems to have
changed the format for their XML variable lookup tables, causing calls
to acs.lookup (and acs.fetch) to fail for &quot;endyear=2016&quot;.  The
(hopefully) temporary solution was to simply use the 2015 lookup tables
for these requests, which should be safe in most situations, since table
numbers and variable codes generally do not change from year to year.
In certain situations, this may not be true: see

<h3>Value</h3>

<p> Returns an acs.lookup class object with the results of the
query.  acs.lookup objects can be subsetted and combined, and passed
to the &quot;variable&quot; argument of <code>acs.fetch</code>.  </p>
