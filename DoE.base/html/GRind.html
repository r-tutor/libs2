<h2>
Functions for calculating generalized resolution, average R-squared values and
squared canonical correlations, and for checking design regularity
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function GR calculates generalized resolution, function GRind calculates
more detailed generalized resolution values, squared canonical correlations
and average R-squared values, the print method for class GRind appropriately prints the
detailed GRind values. Function SCFTs calculates squared canonical correlations for
factorial designs. SCFTs includes more projections than GRind (all full resolution
projections or even all projections) and decides on regularity of the design,
based on a conjecture.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
GR(ID, digits=2)
GRind(design, digits=3, arft=TRUE, scft=TRUE, cancors=FALSE, with.blocks=FALSE)
SCFTs(design, digits = 3, all = TRUE, resk.only = TRUE, kmin = NULL, kmax = ncol(design),
   regcheck = FALSE, arft = TRUE, cancors = FALSE, with.blocks = FALSE)
## S3 method for class 'GRind'
print(x, quote=FALSE,  ...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ID</code></td>
<td>
<p>an orthogonal array, either a matrix or a data frame; need not be of class <code>oa</code>;
can also be a character string containing the name of an array listed in data frame <code><a href="oacat.html">oacat</a></code></p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>digits</code></td>
<td>
<p>number of decimal points to which to round the result</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>design</code></td>
<td>
<p>a factorial design. This can either be a matrix or a data frame
in which all columns are experimental factors, or a special data frame
of class <code><a href="class-design.html">design</a></code>, which may also include response data.<br />
In any case, the design should be a factorial design;
the functions are not useful for quantitative designs (like e.g. latin hypercube samples).

</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>arft</code></td>

<p>logical indicating whether or not the average $R^2$ frequency table
(ARFT, see Gr?mping 2013) is to be returned
</p>

<p>logical indicating whether the squared canonical correlation frequency
table (SCFT, see Gr?mping 2013) is to be returned
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>cancors</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical indicating whether individual canonical correlations
are to be returned (see Groemping 2013). These will not be needed
for normal use of the package.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>with.blocks</code></td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Functions <code>GR</code>, <code>GRind</code>, and <code>SCFTs</code> work for factors only and are not intended
for quantitative variables. Nevertheless it is possible to apply them to class <code><a href="class-design.html">design</a></code> plans with quantitative
variables in them in some situations.
</p>
<p>Function <code>GR</code> calculates the generalized resolution according to Deng and Tang (1999)
for 2-level designs or a generalization thereof according to Groemping (2011) and
Groemping and Xu (2014) for general
orthogonal arrays. It returns a value between 3 and 5, where the numeric value 5 stands for
&ldquo;at least 5&rdquo;. Roughly, generalized resolution measures the closeness of a design
to the next higher resolution (worst-case based, e.g. one completely aliased triple of
factors implies resolution 3).
</p>
<p>Function <code>GRind</code> (newer than <code>GR</code>, and recommended) calculates the generalized
resolution, together with factor wise generalized resolution values, squared canonical correlations
and average R-squared values, as mentioned in Groemping and Xu (2014) and further developed in
Groemping (2013, 2017).
The print method for class <code>Grind</code> objects prints the individual factor components of GRind.i such that they
do not mislead:
Because of the shortest word approach for GR, SCFT and ARFT, a GRind.i component
can be at most one larger than the resolution. For example, if GR is 3.5 so that the
resolution is 3, the largest possible numeric value of a GRind.i component is 4, but it means &quot;&gt;=4&quot;.
</p>
<p>Function <code>SCFTs</code> does more extensive SCFT and ARFT calculations than function <code>GRind</code>:
in particular, the function allows to do such calculations for more projection sizes,
either restricting attention to full resolution projections or going for ALL projections
with non-zero word lengths.
These capabilities have been introduced in relation to regularity checking based on SCFTs
(see Groemping and Bailey 2016):
Defining a factorial design as regular if all main effects are orthogonal in some sense
to effects including other factors of any order, it is conjectured that a regularity check on full resolution
projections only will suffice for identifying non-regularity (work in progress).
However, this is a conjecture only; as long as it is not proven, a definite check for this type of regularity requires checking ALL projections,
i.e. setting <code>resk.only</code> to <code>FALSE</code>. With this setting, the function may run for a very long time
(depends in particular on the number of factors)!
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Function <code>GR</code> returns a list with elements <code>GR</code> (the generalized resolution of the array, a not necessarily integer
number between 3 and 5) and <code>RPFT</code> (the relative projection frequency table).
<code>GR</code> values smaller than 5 are exact, while the number five
stands for &ldquo;at least 5&rdquo;. The resolution itself is the integer portion of <code>GR</code>.
The <code>RPFT</code> element is the relative projection frequency table for 4-factor projections
for <code>GR=5</code>. For unconfounded three- and four-column designs, <code>GR</code> takes the
value <code>Inf</code> (used to be 5 for package versions up to 0.23-4).
</p>
<p>Function <code>GRind</code> works on designs with resolution at least 3 and
returns a list with elements <br />
<code>GRs</code> (the two versions of
generalized resolution described in Groemping and Xu 2014), <br />
the matrix <code>GR.i</code> with rows GRtot.i and GRind.i for the
factor wise generalized resolutions (also in Groemping and Xu 2014), <br />
and optionally <br />
the ARFT (Groemping 2013, 2017), <br />
the SCFT (Groemping 2013, 2017), <br />
and/or the canonical correlations.<br />
The latter are held in an <br />
nfac x choose(nfac-1, R-1) x max(nlev)-1 array <br />
and are supplemented with 0es,
if there are fewer of them than the respective dfi.
</p>
<p>The factor wise generalized resolutions are in the closed interval between
resolution and resolution + 1. In the latter case, their meaning is &quot;at least
resolution + 1&quot;. (The print method ensures that they are printed accordingly,
but the list elements themselves are just the numbers.)
</p>
<p>Function <code>SCFTs</code> returns a list of lists with a component for
each projection size considered. Each such component contains the following entries:
</p>
<table summary="R valueblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>SCFT</code></td>
<td>
<p>Squared canonical correlation table for the projection size</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ARFT </code></td>
<td>
<p>Average R^2 frequency table for the projection size (if requested)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>cancors </code></td>
<td>
<p>canonical correlations (if requested)</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Warning </h3>

<p>The functions have been checked on the types of designs for which
they are intended (especially orthogonal arrays produced with oa.design) and
on 2-level fractional factorial designs produced with package <span class="pkg">FrF2</span>.
They may produce meaningless results for some other types of designs.
