<h2>
Functions to extract a block factor from a class design object 
or to rerandomize a class design object
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function getblock creates block factors for designs with replications, repeated 
measurements or split plot designs. Function rerandomize.design rerandomizes 
an experimental design.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
getblock(design, combine=FALSE, ...)
rerandomize.design(design, seed=NULL, block=NULL, ...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>design</code></td>
<td>

<p>an object of class <code><a href="class-design.html">design</a></code>, which is a design with replications 
or repeated measurements or a split plot design
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>combine</code></td>
<td>

<p>logical with default <code>FALSE</code>. It has an effect for replicated blocked 
and splitplot designs only: If <code>TRUE</code>, all blocking information 
is combined into a single factor. Otherwise, a 
data frame with separate identifiers is returned.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>seed</code></td>
<td>

<p>integer number for initialization of the random number generator 
(needed for repeatable rerandomization) <br />
In R version 3.6.0 and later, the default behavior of function <code><a href="../../base/html/sample.html">sample</a></code>
has changed. If you work in a new (i.e., &gt;= 3.6.-0) R version and want to reproduce 
a rerandomization from an earlier R version (before 3.6.0), 
you have to change the RNGkind setting by<br />
<code>RNGkind(sample.kind="Rounding")</code><br />
before running function <code>rerandomize.design</code>.<br />
It is recommended to change the setting back to the new recommended way afterwards:<br />
<code>RNGkind(sample.kind="default")</code><br />
For an example, see the documentation of the example data set <code><a href="VSGFS.html">VSGFS</a></code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>block</code></td>
<td>

<p>character string giving the name of a block factor (only for unreplicated 
designs that do not have any prior blocking or split plot structure;
meant for block randomization of designs created with function <code>oa.design</code>)
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>

<p>currently not used
</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The purpose of function <code>getblock</code> is to support users in doing their own analyses 
accomodating randomization restrictions like blocking and split plotting 
with R modeling functions. 
</p>
<p>The reason for including designs with proper replications is that these 
are randomized in blocks by packages <span class="pkg">DoE.base</span> and <span class="pkg">FrF2</span> and partly 
by <span class="pkg">DoE.wrapper</span>. 
While the package author does not consider it generally necessary to 
analyze these with a block factor, 
function getblock makes it easy for users with a different opinion 
(or for situations for which time turns out to be important in spite of 
not having explicitly blocked for time) to run an analysis with a block factor
for the replication. 
</p>
<p>For unreplicated split plot designs, a whole plot identifier is returned; 
the design itself contains the plot information via the settings of the 
whole plot factors only. Thus, it may be useful to be able to create the plot 
identifier.
</p>
<p>For replicated block or split plot designs, there is a randomization hierarchy 
that will depend on how the experiment was actually conducted. Therefore, 
a dataframe is generated the columns of which can be used in the appropriate way 
by a statistically literate user. 
</p>
<p>Function <code>rerandomize.design</code> rerandomizes a design. This can be useful if 
the user wants to obtain unblocked replications (packages <code>DoE.base</code> and <span class="pkg">FrF2</span> 
usually randomize in blocks on time) or wants to freely randomize the center point 
position over the whole range of the experiment (or a block, respectively), 
or if the user wants to also randomize the 
blocks (rather than randomizing the block units to the experimental blocks 
outside of the design), 
or if the user wants to do block randomization on a block factor specified with 
the <code>block</code> option  
for a design created with function <code>oa.design</code> or <code>pb</code> (which do not offer 
explicit specification of blocking).<br />
It can also be useful for ensuring a randomization that has little correlation 
between run order and model matrix columns; this correlation can e.g. be checked with 
the help of function <code><a href="corrPlot.html">corrPlot</a></code>, using the option <code>run.order=TRUE</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Function <code>getblock</code> returns <br />
a single factor with block information (for split plot designs without replication 
or replicated designs without randomization restrictions) <br />
or a data frame with several blocking factors (for designs with randomization 
restrictions and replication).
</p>
<p>Function <code>rerandomize.design</code> returns a class <code>design</code> object; 
note that it will not be possible to add center points after re-randomization, 
i.e. if required, center points have to be added before using the function.
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>Since R version 3.6.0, the behavior of function <code><a href="../../base/html/sample.html">sample</a></code> has changed 
(correction of a biased previous behavior that should not be relevant for the randomization of designs). 
For reproducing a re-randomization that was produced with an earlier R version, 
please follow the steps described with the argument <code>seed</code>.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
   ## a blocked full factorial design
   ff &lt;- fac.design(nlevels=c(2,2,2,3,3,3), blocks=6, bbrep=2, wbrep=2, repeat.only=FALSE)
   getblock(ff)
   getblock(ff, combine=TRUE)
   rerandomize.design(ff)
   ff &lt;- fac.design(nlevels=c(2,2,2,3,3,3), replications=2, repeat.only=FALSE)
   getblock(ff)  
   ff &lt;- fac.design(nlevels=c(2,2,2,3,3,3), replications=2, repeat.only=FALSE)
   try(getblock(ff))
   ## a design created with oa.design
   small &lt;- oa.design(nlevels=c(2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8))
   rerandomize.design(small, block="J")
