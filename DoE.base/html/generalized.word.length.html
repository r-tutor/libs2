<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>design</code></td>
<td>
<p>an experimental design. This can either be a matrix or a data frame
in which all columns are experimental factors, or a special data frame
of class <code><a href="class-design.html">design</a></code>, which may also include response data.<br />
In any case, the design should be a factorial design;
the functions are not useful for quantitative designs (like e.g. latin hypercube samples).
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>with.blocks</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical, indicating whether or not an existing block factor
is to be included into word counting. This option is ignored if <code>design</code>
is not of class <code>design</code>.<br />
Per default, an existing block factor is ignored.<br />
For designs without a block factor, the option does not have an effect.<br />
If the design is blocked, and <code>with.blocks</code>
is <code>TRUE</code>, the block factor is treated like any other factor in terms of word counting.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>J</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical, indicating whether or not a vector of contributions from
individual degrees of freedom is produced. If <code>TRUE</code>, the entries of the vector
are absolute normalized J-characteristics from all 3- or 4-factor products respectively,
based on normalized Helmert contrasts (cf. Ai and Zhang 2004). <br />
This is not expected to be useful for practical purposes.<br />
<code>J</code> cannot be <code>TRUE</code> simultaneously with <code>separate</code> or <code>rela</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>rela</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical indicating whether the word lengths are to be calculated in
absolute terms (as usual) or relative to the maximum possible word length in case of
complete aliasing; if <code>TRUE</code>, each word length is divided by the worst
case word length (that corresponds to a completely aliased set of factors)
derived in Groemping (2011).<br />
<code>rela=TRUE</code> is only permitted for the shortest possible word length,
i.e. <code>length3</code> or <code>P3.3</code> for resolution III designs,

<code>J</code> or <code>separate</code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>separate</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical, indicating whether or not separate (and overlapping)
sums are requested for each two-factor interaction;
the idea is to be able to identify clear two-factor interactions;
this may be useful for a design for which <code>length3</code> returns zero,
in analogy to clear 2fis for regular fractional factorials,
implemented in function <code><a href="../../FrF2/html/FrF2.html">FrF2</a></code>; this
is currently experimental and may be removed again if it does not prove useful.<br />

</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>all</code></td>

<p>logical; if <code>FALSE</code>, the search stops whenever a design with 0 generalized words
of highest requested length is found; otherwise, the function always determines all best designs</p>
</td></tr>

for one variant to be compared; the matrix columns must correspond to the entries of the <code>nlevels</code>
option</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>crit</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string that requests <code>"total"</code> or <code>"worst"</code> triple optimization;

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These functions work for factors only and are not intended for quantitative variables.
Nevertheless it is possible to apply them to class <code><a href="class-design.html">design</a></code> plans with quantitative
variables in them in some situations.
</p>
<p>The generalized word length pattern as introduced in Xu and Wu (2001) is the basis
for the functions described here. Consult their article or Groemping (2011)
for rigorous mathematical detail of this concept. A brief explanation is also given here,
before explaining the details for the functions: Assume a design with qualitative
factors, for which all factors are coded with specially normalized Helmert <code><a href="../../stats/html/contrasts.html">contrasts</a></code>
(which orthogonalizes the model matrix columns to the intercept column).
Functions <code>contr.XuWu</code> and <code>contr.XuWuPoly</code> provide such contrasts
based on Helmert contrasts or orthogonal polynomial contrasts,
normalized according to the prescription by Xu and Wu (2001)
which implies that all model matrix columns
have Euclidean norm <code>sqrt(n)</code>, provided that each
individual factor is balanced.<br />
Then, the number of generalized words of length 3 is determined by taking the sum
of squares of the column averages of all three-factor interaction columns
(from a model matrix with all three-factor interactions included). <br />
Likewise, the number of generalized words of length 4 is determined by taking the sum
of squares of the column averages of all four-factor interaction columns
(from a model matrix with all four-factor interactions included), and so on.<br />
A certain plausibility can be found in these numbers by noting that they provide the
more well-known word length pattern for regular fractional factorial 2-level designs,
implying that they are exactly zero for resolution IV or resolution V fractional
factorial 2-level designs, respectively. Furthermore, Groemping and Xu (2014) provided
an interpretation in terms of R^2-values from linear models for the number of
shortest words.
</p>
<p>Function <code>lengths</code> calculates the generalized word length
pattern (numbers of generalized words of lengths 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively),
functions <code>length2</code>, <code>length3</code>, <code>length4</code> and <code>length5</code> calculate
each length separately. For designs with few rows and many columns, the newer
function <code><a href="GWLP.html">GWLP</a></code> is much faster; therefore it will be a better choice
than <code>lengths</code> for most applications. On the other hand, for designs with
many rows, <code>lengths</code> can be much faster. Furthermore, <code>lengths</code> and
the compoment functions <code>length2</code> to <code>length5</code> can calculate additional
detail not available from <code><a href="GWLP.html">GWLP</a></code>.
</p>
<p>The most important component length functions are
<code>length3</code> and <code>length4</code>; <code>length2</code>
should yield zero for all orthogonal arrays, and <code>length5</code> will in most
cases not be of interest either. The number of shortest possible words, e.g.
length 4 for resolution IV designs, can be calculated in relative terms, if
interest is in the extent of complete aliasing (cf. Groemping 2011).<br />
The length functions are fast for small numbers of factors but can take a
long time if the number of factors is large. Note that an orthogonal array
based design is called resolution III if the result of
function <code>length3</code> is non-zero, resolution IV,
if the result of function <code>length3</code> is zero and the
result of function <code>length4</code> is non-zero,
and resolution V+ (at least V), if the result of both functions <code>length3</code>
and <code>length4</code> are zero.
</p>
<p>Functions <code>P3.3</code> and <code>P4.4</code>
calculate the pattern of generalized words of length 3 for all three-factor
projections of an array and of generalized words of length 3 or 4 for all four-factor
projections of an array. Calculation of such projection frequency tables has been proposed
by Xu, Cheng and Wu (2004). The relative version for <code>P3.3</code> and <code>P4.4</code> has been
introduced by Groemping (2011) for better assessment of the projective properties of a design.
It divides each absolute number of words by the maximum possible number in case one
factor is completely determined by the combinations of the other two factors.
For <code>P4.4</code>, the relative version is valid only for resolution IV designs.
NOTE: For mixed-level designs, it is meanwhile recommended to use
ARFTs (Groemping 2013, 2017) instead of relative <code>P3.3</code> and <code>P4.4</code>;
these can be obtained by functions <code><a href="GRind.html">GRind</a></code> or <code><a href="GRind.html">SCFTs</a></code>
and have relevant advantages over the projection frequency tables from <code>P3.3</code> and <code>P4.4</code>
for mixed level designs. SCFTs (also treated in Groemping 2013, 2017) provide more detail
than ARFTs and are interesting for assessing the suitability of a design for screening purposes.
</p>
<p>The functions can be used in selecting among different possibilities to accomodate factors
within a given orthogonal array (cf. examples). For general purposes, it is recommended
to use designs with as small an outcome of <code>length3</code> as possible (either absolute or relative,
either total or worst case), and within the same result
for <code>length3</code> (particularly 0), with as small a result for <code>length4</code> as possible. This
corresponds to (a step towards) generalized minimum aberration. It can also be useful
to consider the patterns, particularly <code>P3.3</code>, or for mixed levels the aforementioned
ARFTs or SCFTs obtainable with functions <code><a href="GRind.html">GRind</a></code> or <code><a href="GRind.html">SCFTs</a></code>.
Note that some overall information on a design's behavior is available in the catalogue data frames
<code><a href="oacat.html">oacat</a></code> and <code><a href="oacat.html">oacat3</a></code> and can be queried with function <code><a href="show.oas.html">show.oas</a></code>;
this helps for selecting a suitable array from which to start optimization efforts (see below).
</p>
<p>Functions <code>oa.min3</code>, <code>oa.min4</code>, <code>oa.min34</code>
optimize column allocation for a given array
for which a certain factor combination must be accomodated: They return designs that allocate
columns such that the number of generalized words of length 3 is minimized (<code>oa.min3</code>;
with a choice between minimizing the total number or minimizing the number for the worst-case triple
of factors), or
the number of generalized words of length 4 is minimized within all designs for which the number
of generalized words of length 3 is minimal (<code>oa.min34</code>, total number only); 
<code>oa.min4</code> does the same as <code>oa.min3</code>, but for designs of resolution IV, either entirely 
(e.g. designs from <code>oacat3</code>) or through the selection of suitable column variants.
Option <code>rela</code> allows to switch
from the default consideration of absolute numbers of words to relative numbers of words
according to Groemping (2011). This relative number corresponds to concentrating on the worst-case
ARFT entry for each set of R factors (R the resolution).
</p>
<p>Function <code>oa.maxGR</code> maximizes generalized resolution
according to Deng and Tang (1999) as generalized by Groemping (2011).    
**Note that function <code>oa.maxGR</code>
can be replaced by the much faster function <code>oa.min3</code> with options
<code>crit="worst"</code> and <code>rela=TRUE</code>, whenever GR&lt;=4. Only for designs with
GR &gt; 4, the extra effort with function <code>oa.maxGR</code> is useful.**
</p>
<p>Function <code>oa.minRelProjAberr</code> conducts minimum relative projection aberration
according to Groemping (2011), with the four steps <br /> 
(a) maximize GR (using function 
<code>oa.min3</code> with options <code>crit="worst"</code> and <code>rela=TRUE</code>), <br />
(b) minimize rA3 or
rA4 (depending on resolution), <br />
(c) optimize RPFT (as obtained by <code>P3.3</code>
or <code>P4.4</code>) and <br />
(d) minimize absolute words of lengths 4 etc. (only carried through
to length 4 by the function).
</p>
<p>Functions <code>oa.max3</code> and <code>oa.max4</code>
do the opposite: they search for the worst design in terms of the number of
generalized words of lengths 3 or 4. Such a design can e.g. be used
for demonstrating the benefit of optimizing the number of words,
or for exemplifying theoretical properties.
Occasionally, it may also be useful,
if there are severe restrictions on possible combinations.
(<code>oa.max4</code> should only be used for resolution IV designs.)
</p>
<p>Function <code>tupleSel</code> selects worst case tuples of R factors for resolution R designs.
Depending on the type requested, all completely aliased tuples are selected,
or the worst case tuples that exceed the <code>1-selprop</code> quantile of the numbers
of absolute or relative words are selected.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The functions <code>length3</code> and <code>length4</code> (currently) per default
return the number of generalized words. <br />
If option <code>J=TRUE</code> is set, their value
is a named vector of normalized absolute J-characteristics (cf. Ai and Zhang 2004)
for the respective length, based on normalized Helmert contrasts,
with names indicating factor indices.
(For blocked designs with the <code>with.blocks=TRUE</code> option,
the block factor has index 1.)
</p>
<p>Functions <code>P3.3</code> and <code>P4.4</code> return a matrix
with the numbers of generalized words of length 3 (4) that do occur
for 3 (4) factor projections (column <code>length3</code> or <code>length4</code> resp.)
and their frequencies. If option <code>rela=TRUE</code> is set, the numbers of generalized
words are normalized by dividing them by the number of words that corresponds
to perfect aliasing among the factors for each projection. For <code>P4.4</code>, the
relative version is only reasonable for resolution IV designs.
The matrix of projection frequencies has the overall number of generalized words
of the respective length as an attribute; in the case <code>rela=TRUE</code> it also
has the generalized resolution and the overall absolute number of generalized words
of the respective length as an attribute.
</p>
<p>The functions <code>oa.min3</code>, <code>oa.min34</code>, <code>oa.max3</code> and <code>oa.max4</code>
(currently) return a list with elements
<code>GWP</code> (the number(s) of generalized words of length 3 (lengths 3 and 4))
<code>column.variants</code> (the columns to be used for design creation, ordered with
ascending nlevels) and <code>complete</code> (logical indicating whether or not the list is
guaranteed to be complete).
<code>oa.min3</code>, the name of the first element is either <code>GWP3</code> (<code>crit="total"</code>),
<code>worst.a3</code> (<code>rela=FALSE, crit="worst"</code>) or <code>GR</code> (<code>rela=FALSE, crit="worst"</code>).
The function <code>oa.maxGR</code> returns a list with elements <code>GR</code>, <code>column.variants</code>
and <code>complete</code>, the function <code>oa.minRelProjAberr</code> returns a list with elements
<code>GR</code>, <code>GWP</code>, <code>column.variants</code> and <code>complete</code>.
</p>
<p>The function <code>nchoosek</code> returns a matrix with k rows and <code>choose(n, k)</code> columns,
each of which contains a different subset of k elements.
</p>
<p>The function <code>tupleSel</code> returns a sorted list of worst case tuples,
beginning with the worst case. In case of types <code>"worst"</code> or <code>"worst.rel"</code>,
attributes provide the (relative) projection frequency tables and the sorted
vector of the worst case projection values corresponding to the listed tuples.
</p>


<h3>Warning </h3>

<p>The functions have been checked on the types of designs for which
they are intended (especially orthogonal arrays produced with oa.design) and
on 2-level fractional factorial designs produced with package <span class="pkg">FrF2</span>.
They may produce meaningless results for some other types of designs.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, all optimizing functions work for relatively small problems only
and will break down for larger problems because of storage space requirements
(size depends on the number of possible selections among columns; for example, selecting
9 out of 31 columns is not doable on my computer because of storage space issues,
while selecting 29 out of 31 columns is doable within the available storage space).
Programming of a less storage-intensive algorithm is underway.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Function <code>nchoosek</code> has been taken from <span class="pkg">Bioconductor</span> package <span class="pkg">vsn</span>.<br />
Function <code>GWLP</code> is much faster (but also more inaccurate) than function <code>lengths</code>
and may be a better choice for designs with many factors.</p>
