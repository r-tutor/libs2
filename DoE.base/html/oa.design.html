<p> minimum number of runs to be used,
can be omitted if obvious from <code>ID</code> or if
the smallest possible array is to be found </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>nfactors</code></td>
<td>
<p> number of factors;
only needed if <code>nlevels</code> is a single number and
<code>factor.names</code> is omitted;
can otherwise determined from length of <code>factor.names</code>,
<code>nlevels</code> or <code>column</code> </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>nlevels</code></td>
<td>
<p> number(s) of levels, vector with <code>nfactors</code> entries or single number;
can be omitted, if obvious from <code>factor.names</code> or if <code>ID</code>
and <code>columns</code> are given or if all columns of <code>ID</code> are to be used
with default factor names and levels;
can be a single number if <code>nfactors</code> is known directly or as length of

the elements of the list are <br />
EITHER vectors of appropriate length (corresponding to <code>nlevels</code>)
with factor levels for the respective factor<br />
OR empty strings;<br />
Default factor names are the first elements of the character vector <code><a href="utilities.html">Letters</a></code>,
or the factors position numbers preceded by capital F in case of more than 50 factors.
Default factor levels are the numbers from 1 to the number of levels for each factor.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>columns</code></td>
<td>

<p>EITHER<br />
a vector of column numbers referring to columns of design <code>ID</code>,
assigning a specific column of the array to each factor;<br />
this can only be specified, if <code>ID</code> is also given;<br />
OR<br />
a string that defines the degree of optimization requested
in terms of column allocation (cf. section &ldquo;Details&rdquo;):
choices are <code>"order"</code>, <code>"min3"</code>, <code>"min34"</code>,
<code>"min3.rela"</code>, <code>"min34.rela"</code>, <code>"minRPFT"</code>
or <code>"minRelProjAberr"</code>.<br />
For resource reasons, the default is <code>"order"</code>, but smaller designs
can sometimes be substantially improved with other choices.
Cf. the &ldquo;Details&rdquo; section for the
meaning of the character string specifications for <code>columns.</code>
Column optimization can be computationally intensive. If it cannot
be accomplished with the given ressources, a warning is issued, and
an unoptimized design is returned.<br />
Some of the optimization methods have just been proposed, and there is
little experience with them. It is strongly recommended to always check
the properties of the design w.r.t. suitability for the planned experiment
BEFORE starting expensive investments.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Package <span class="pkg">DoE.base</span> is described in Groemping (2016), which is a preprint of a paper in the
Journal of Statistical Software. This paper also has detailed material on function <code>oa.design</code>.
</p>
<p>Function <code>oa.design</code> assigns factors to the columns of orthogonal arrays that are
available within package <span class="pkg">DoE.base</span> or are provided by the user.
The available arrays and their properties are listed in the
data frame <code>oacat</code> and can be systematically searched for using function <code><a href="show.oas.html">show.oas</a></code>.
The design names also indicate the number of runs and the numbers of factors
for each number of levels, e.g. <code>L18.3.6.6.1</code> is an 18 run design with six factors in 3 levels
(<code>3.6</code>) and one factor in 6 levels (<code>6.1</code>).
</p>
<p><code>oa</code> is the S3 class used for orthogonal arrays. Objects of class <code>oa</code> should at least have
the attribute <code>origin</code>, an attribute <code>comment</code> should be used for additional information.
</p>
<p>Users can define their own orthogonal arrays and hand them to <code>oa.design</code> with parameter <code>ID</code>.<br />
Requirements for the arrays: <br />
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Factor levels must be coded as numbers from 1 to number of levels.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The array must be of classes <code>oa</code> and <code>matrix</code><br />
(If your array is a matrix named <code>foo</code>, you can simply assign it class <code>oa</code> by
the command <code>class(foo) &lt;- c("oa","matrix")</code>, see also last example.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The array should have an attribute <code>origin</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The array can have an attribute <code>comment</code>; <br />
this should be used for mentioning specific properties, e.g.
for the <code>L18.2.1.3.7</code> that the interaction of the first two factors
can be estimated.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Users are encouraged to send additional arrays to the package maintainer.
The requirements for these are the same as listed above, with attribute <code>origin</code>
being a MUST in this case. (See the last example for how to assign an attribute.)<br />
For relatively small important applications, creation of a tailor-made array of class <code>oa</code> can 
be attempted with package <span class="pkg">DoE.MIParray</span>, which uses mixed integer optimization for creating 
a design from scratch (see Gr√∂mping and Fontana 2019 for the algorithm behind that approach).<br /> 
</p>
<p>The data frame <code><a href="oacat.html">oacat</a></code> lists the orthogonal arrays from Warren Kuhfelds
collection of &ldquo;parent&rdquo; and &ldquo;child&rdquo; arrays. The parent arrays, 
plus a few additional arrays, are directly exported from the package namespace. 
The child arrays from Kuhfelds collection can be constructed from these, using
the replacement instructions provided in the variable <code>lineage</code> of <code>oacat</code>.    
The last example below indicates how
a child array can be created manually, and compares this to the automatically created array.<br />
(A lot more than just the child arrays could be obtained from these arrays
by implementing a functionality similar to the market research macros available in SAS; presumably,
this topic will not be addressed soon, as it will involve a substantial amount of work.)
</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are stronger arrays 
(at least resolution IV) in the catalogue <code><a href="oacat.html">oacat3</a></code>. Since version 1.1, 
function <code>oa.design</code> uses the stronger arrays, where possible. 
</p>
<p>If no specific orthogonal array is specified and function <code>oa.design</code> does not
find an orthogonal array that meets the specified requirements,
<code>oa.design</code> returns a full factorial, replicated for enough residual degrees of freedom, if necessary.
If <code>oa.design</code> has not found an array smaller than the full factorial, it is
absolutely possibly that a smaller array does exist nevertheless. It may be worth
while checking with oacat whether an appropriate smaller array can be found by
combining some of the parent arrays listed there (looking for a design with a few
factors in 5 runs, you may e.g. call <code>oacat[oacat$n5&gt;0,]$name</code> in order to see the
names of more promising candidate arrays for combination, or you may also want to look
up arrays with <code>n25&gt;0</code> subsequently.
</p>
<p>With version 0.9-18 of the package,
the possibility for an automatic allocation of columns for improved design
performance was implemented. With version 0.23, this approach has been sped
up and extended to properly cover relative projection aberration according to
Groemping (2011) with and without step (b) (see below) (the previous choice
<code>"maxGR.min34"</code> was modified and renamed to <code>"minRelProjAberr"</code>).<br />
Because of performance reasons, and because of a lack of a clear best default,
optimum column allocation is not switched on per default.
However, with the default column order from left to right,
the package always issues a warning to remind users that an automatic unoptimized design
can be quite far from ideal.
If optimization is activated, the first step is selection of an array,
either explicitly by the user (option <code>ID</code>) or automatically (unoptimized)
according to the required combination of factors. Within that array, the following
choices for the <code>column</code> option are on offer:<br />
</p>

<dl>
<dt>&quot;order&quot;</dt><dd><p>the default choice; allocates factors from left to right, which
is what most software does (but what is not necessarily good, see also the example section)</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>"min3"</code></dt><dd><p><b>recommended</b>, if <code>"min34"</code> is not affordable; 
aliasing between main effects and 2-factor
interactions is kept to a minimal degree,
minimizing the number of generalized words of length 3 according to Xu and Wu (2001)</p>
</dd>
<dt>&quot;min3.rela&quot;</dt><dd><p>the same approach is taken, but with
<em>relative</em> number of generalized words according to Groemping (2011)</p>
</dd>
<dt>&quot;min34&quot;</dt><dd><p><b>recommended</b>, if affordable; 
beware the time demand; this requests
that the number of words of generalized length 4 is also minimized.</p>
</dd>
<dt>&quot;min34.rela&quot;</dt><dd><p>again takes the same approach, but with
<em>relative</em> number of generalized words according to Groemping (2011)</p>
</dd>
<dt>&quot;minRPFT&quot;</dt><dd><p>minimizes the relative projection frequency table, applying the
approach according to Groemping (2011) without step (b) (see next entry).</p>
</dd>
<dt>&quot;minRelProjAberr&quot;</dt><dd><p>applies minimum relative projection aberration
according to Groemping (2011)
((a): maximize generalized resolution,
(b): minimize total relative number of shortest words, (c) rank designs
according to relative projection frequency table (obtainable with P3.3 or P4.4, depending on resolution)
and (d) resolve ties by looking at absolute number of length 4 words in case of resolution III).</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>WARNING: Usually, it is recommended to investigate the properties of a design automatically
created by function <code>oa.design</code> before starting experimentation.
While all designs can estimate main effects <em>in the absence of interactions</em>,
the presence of interactions may render some designs useless or even dangerous.
Deliberate choice of columns different from the default may improve a design
(see example section)!
</p>
<p>Mathematical comment on the expansion example:
There are 720 different ways to expand the unique <code>L18.3.6.6.1</code>
into an <code>L18.2.1.3.7</code>, depending on which row of the replacement design
<code>nest.des</code> is assigned to which level of the 6 level factor; 
for qualitative factors, 
60 of these are potentially non-isomorphic (divide 720 by the 2 * 3! ways 
of permuting levels within a factor; there are
more possibly different arrays for quantitative 3 level factors, since arbitrary
relabelling of the levels is no longer isomorphic).
According to Eric Schoen (personal communication), for this particular case, 
all the resulting children
are isomorphic to each other and are also isomorphic to the Taguchi L18.
To see isomorphism of two designs is not easy; in the example, <code>nest.des</code>
has been prepared such that it is easy to see isomorphism of the resulting
child to the Taguchi <code>L18</code>: <code>L18</code> is reproduced by
assigning the first row of <code>nest.des</code> to level 1 etc.,
except for a swap of columns <code>G</code> and <code>H</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>oa.design</code> returns a data frame of S3 class <code><a href="class-design.html">design</a></code>
with attributes attached.
</p>
<p>In the data frame itself, the experimental factors are all stored as R factors. <br />
For factors with 2 levels, <code><a href="contr.FrF2.html">contr.FrF2</a></code> contrasts (-1 / +1) are used. <br />
For factors with more than 2 numerical levels, polynomial contrasts are used
(i.e. analyses will per default use orthogonal polynomials). <br />
For factors with more than 2 categorical levels, the default contrasts are used.<br />
Future versions will most likely allow more user control about the type of
contrasts to be used.
</p>
<p>The <code>desnum</code> and <code>run.order</code> attributes of class <code><a href="class-design.html">design</a></code> are
as usual. In the <code>design.info</code> attribute, the following elements are specific for
this type of designs:
</p>
<table summary="R valueblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>is <code>oa</code> (unless no special orthogonal array is found, in which case
a full factorial is created instead, cf. <code><a href="fac.design.html">fac.design</a></code> for its <code>design.info</code> attribute),</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>nlevels</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector containing the number of levels for each factor</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>generating.oa</code></td>
<td>
<p>contains information on the generating orthogonal array,</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>selected.columns</code></td>
<td>
<p>contains information, which column of the orthogonal array underlies which factor,</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>origin</code></td>
<td>
<p>contains the respective attribute of the orthogonal array,</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>comment</code></td>
<td>
<p>contains the respective attribute of the orthogonal array,</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>residual.df</code></td>
<td>
<p>contains the requested residual degrees of freedom for a main effects model.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Other information is generic, like documented for class <code><a href="class-design.html">design</a></code>.
</p>
<p>Function <code>origin</code> returns the origin attribute of the orthogonal array <code>ID</code>,
functions <code><a href="../../base/html/comment.html">comment</a></code> and <code>"comment&lt;-"</code> from package <span class="pkg">base</span>
return and set the comment attribute.
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>Since version 1.1 of the package, strength 3 arrays are automatically used, if available. 
This changes the behavior of function <code>oa.design</code> for situations for requests with a 
combination of <code>nruns</code> and <code>nlevels</code> for which a strength 3 array exists in <code>oacat3</code>. 
If the old behavior is required for reproducing a previously-created array, it is 
possible to set <code>oacat3</code> to <code>NULL</code> by the command <code>assignInNamespace("oacat3", NULL, pos="package:DoE.base")</code>; 
this temporary replacement of <code>oacat3</code> with <code>NULL</code> remains in effect 
for the current R session; detaching it (with namespace unloading) and reloading is possible but can also go wrong; 
therefore, it is recommended to only use the above technique if you are prepared to restart the 
R session before using the original version of <code>oacat3</code>.
</p>
<p>Since R version 3.6.0, the behavior of function <code><a href="../../base/html/sample.html">sample</a></code> has changed 
(correction of a biased previous behavior that should not be relevant for the randomization of designs). 
For reproducing a randomized design that was produced with an earlier R version, 
please follow the steps described with the argument <code>seed</code>.
