<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>design</code></td>
<td>
<p> data frame of S3 class <code>design</code>. For the structures of design 
objects, refer to the details section and to the value sections of the 
functions that create them. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>undesigned</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object that is currently not a design but could be (e.g. obtained by applying function <code>undesign</code></p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>value</code></td>
<td>
<p> an appropriate replacement value:<br />
a numeric version of the design matrix for function <code>desnum</code> (usage not encouraged for non-experts!)<br />
a run order data frame for function <code>run.order</code> (usage not encouraged for non-experts!)<br />
a list with appropriate design information for function <code>design.info</code> (usage not encouraged for non-experts!)<br />
for function <code>`factor.names&lt;-`</code> a character vector of new factor names (levels remain unchanged) 
or a named list of level combinations for the factors, 
like <code>factor.names</code> in function <code><a href="fac.design.html">fac.design</a></code> <br />
for function <code>`response.names&lt;-`</code> a character vector of response names referring to variables 
which are already available in <code>design</code>
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>contr.modify</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether contrasts are to be modified to match the new levels;
relevant for R factors only, not for numeric design variables;<br /> 
if <code>TRUE</code>, factors with 2 levels get -1/+1 contrasts, factors with more than two quantitative levels 
get polynomial contrasts with scores identical to the factor levels, and factors with more than two 
character levels get treatment contrasts; if FALSE, the contrasts remain unchanged from their previous state.<br />
If solely the contrasts are to be changed, function <code><a href="qua.design.html">change.contr</a></code> is preferrable.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>levordold</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether the level ordering should follow the old function behavior;<br />
the new behavior (from version 0.27) is more plausible, in that the level ordering in the 
new <code>factor.names</code> corresponds to the <code>factor.names</code> entry of the <code>design.info</code> 
attribute; previously, the automatic level ordering of factor levels deviated from that order 
which even led to a changed level order when reassigning exactly the <code>factor.names</code> element 
of the <code>design.info</code> attribute</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>remove</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether responses not indicated in <code>value</code> are to be removed from 
the design altogether. <br />
If <code>TRUE</code>, the respective columns are deleted from the design. 
Otherwise, the columns remain in the data frame but loose their status as a response variable. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>colnames</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector of names of columns to be removed from the design;
design factors or the block factor cannot be removed; with non-numeric variables, 
the <code>desnum</code> attribute of the design may have to be manually modified for 
removing the respective columns in some cases.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>matrix</code></td>
<td>
<p>matrix, data frame or also object of class design that is to be ordered column by column</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>decreasing</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical, indicates whether decreasing order or not (increasing is default)</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Items of class <code>design</code> are data frames with attributes. They are generated 
by various functions that create experimental designs (cf. see also section), and 
by various utility functions for designs like 
the above extractor function for class <code>design</code> or 
<code><a href="../../RcmdrPlugin.DoE/html/fix.html">fix.design</a></code>.
</p>
<p>The data frame itself always contains the design in uncoded form. For many 
design generation functions, these are factors. For designs for quantitative factors 
(bbd, ccd, lhs, 2-level designs with center points), the design variables are numeric. 
This is always indicated by the design.info element quantitative, for which all components 
are <code>TRUE</code> in that case. 
</p>
<p>Generally, its attributes are <code>desnum</code>, 
<code>run.order</code>, and <code>design.info</code>.<br /> 
Attribute <code>desnum</code> contains 
a numeric coded version of the design. For factor design variables, the content of 
<code>desnum</code> depends on the contrast information of the factors (cf. <code><a href="qua.design.html">change.contr</a></code> 
for modifying this).<br />  
Attribute <code>run.order</code> is a data frame 
with run order information (standard order, randomized order, order with replication info), <br />
and the details of <code>design.info</code> partly depend on the type of design. 
</p>
<p><code>design.info</code> generally is a list with first element <code>type</code>, 
further info on the design, 
and some options of the design call regarding randomization and replication. 
For almost all design types, elements include 
</p>

<dl>
<dt>nruns</dt><dd><p>number of runs (not adjusted for replications)</p>
</dd>
<dt>nfactors</dt><dd><p>number of factors</p>
</dd>
<dt>factor.names</dt><dd><p>named list, as can be handed to function <code><a href="oa.design.html">oa.design</a></code></p>
</dd>
<dt>replications</dt><dd><p>the integer number of replications (1=unreplicated)</p>
</dd> 
<dt>repeat.only</dt><dd><p>logical indicating whether replications are only repeat runs but not 
truly replicated</p>
</dd>
<dt>randomize</dt><dd><p>logical indicating whether the experiment was randomized</p>
</dd> 
<dt>seed</dt><dd><p>the integer seed handed to the function call by the user </p>
</dd>
<dt>response.names</dt><dd><p>in the presence of response data only; 
the character vector identifying response columns in the data frame</p>
</dd> 
<dt>creator</dt><dd><p>contains the call or 
(in the future) the list of menu settings within the currently developed 
package <span class="pkg">RcmdrPlugin.DoE</span> that led to creation of the design.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>For some design types, notably designs of types starting with &ldquo;FrF2&rdquo; and 
designs that have been created by combining other designs, 
there can be substantial additional information available from the <code>design.info</code> 
attribute in specialized situations. Detailed information on the structure of the 
<code>design.info</code> attribute 
can be found in the value sections of the respective functions. A tabular overview 
of the available <code>design.info</code> elements is given on the authors homepage.
</p>
<p>Function <code>undesign</code> removes all design-related attributes from a class design 
object; this may be necessary for making some independent code work on design objects. 
(For example, function <code><a href="../../stats/html/reshape.html">reshape</a></code> from package <span class="pkg">stats</span> does not 
work on a class design object, presumably because of the specific extractor method for class <code>design</code>.) 
Occasionally, one may also want 
to reconnect a processed undesigned object to its design properties. This is the purpose of 
function <code>redesign</code>.
</p>
<p>The functions <code>desnum</code>, <code>run.order</code>, and <code>design.info</code> extract 
the respective attribute, i.e. e.g. function <code>design.info</code> 
extracts the design information for the design. The corresponding assignment 
functions should only be used by very experienced users, as they may 
mess up things badly if they are used naively .
</p>
<p>The functions <code>factor.names</code> and <code>response.names</code> extract the 
respective elements of the <code>design.info</code> attribute. The corresponding assignment 
functions allow to change factor names and/or factor codes and to exclude or include 
a numeric variable from the list of responses that are recognized as such by analysis 
procedures. Note that the <code>response.names</code> function can (on request, not by default) 
remove response variables from the data frame <code>design</code>. However, it is not directly able to 
add new responses from outside the data frame <code>design</code>. This is what the 
function <code><a href="add.response.html">add.response</a></code> is for.
</p>
<p>Function <code>col.remove</code> removes columns from the design and returns the 
design without these columns and an intact class <code>design</code> structure. 
</p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Note that R contains a few functions that generate or work with an S class <code>design</code>, 
which is cursorily documented in Appendix B of the white book (Chambers and Hastie 1993) 
to consist of a data frame of R factors which will later be extended by numeric response columns. 
Most class design objects as defined in packages <span class="pkg">DoE.base</span> and <span class="pkg">FrF2</span> are also 
compatible with this older class <code>design</code>; they are not, however, as soon as quantitative 
factors are involved, like for designs with center points in package <code>FrF2</code> or for most designs in 
package <span class="pkg">DoE.wrapper</span> (not yet on CRAN). If feasible with reasonable effort 
and useful, functions for the class <code>design</code> documented here incorporate the functions 
for the S class design (notably function <code><a href="plot.design.html">plot.design</a></code>). 
</p>
<p>This package is currently subject to intensive development; most key functionality is now included. 
Some changes to input and output structures may still occur.
