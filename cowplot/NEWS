cowplot 0.7.0
----------------------------------------------------------------
- This version of cowplot has been prepared for the upcoming release of ggplot2 2.2.0. As a result of this upcoming switch, the function switch_axis_position() has been removed. Alternative axes will be natively supported by ggplot2 2.2.0.
- As of this version, cowplot requires R >= 3.3.0. This dependency was added because R 3.3 fixes a critical problem with lists of units.

cowplot 0.6.3
----------------------------------------------------------------
- Adds a get_legend() function that extracts the legend from a plot. Code provided by https://github.com/marcus1487

- Fixes bug that hardcoded panel border line-type and size. Fix provided by Spencer Fox, https://github.com/sjfox
- Adds the option of custom axes on the drawing layer. Code provided by https://github.com/zaczap
- Separates out the alignment function from plot_grid(). Will likely be more useful further down the line. Code provided by Spencer Fox, https://github.com/sjfox

cowplot 0.6.2
----------------------------------------------------------------
- Updated plot_grid vignette so the tutorial on aligning plots of different types works again. This stopped working at some point and was removed from 0.6.1.
