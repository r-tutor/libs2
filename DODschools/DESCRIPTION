Description: 
    'Rmarkdown' templates comforming to the style guides for Department of Defense (DoD) academic institutions.
    As of Verison 1.0.0, templates have been developed for the DoD graduate schools: the Air Force Institute of Technology 
    (AFIT) and the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS).  Subsequent versions will include templates for the United States Military 
    Academy (USMA), the United States Naval Academy (USNA), and the United States Air Force
    Academy (USAFA).  In addition, functions are provided to simplify tasks such as generating required forms,
    parsing metadata to fill forms, importing reference metadata from works published to the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC).
    Finally, 'Rmarkdown' templates are included for creating HTML presentations.
