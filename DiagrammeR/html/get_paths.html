<h2>Get paths from a specified node in a directed graph</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Obtain a list of all possible paths
from a given node within a directed graph
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
get_paths(graph, from = NULL, to = NULL, shortest_path = FALSE,
  longest_path = FALSE, distance = NULL)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>a graph object of class
<code>dgr_graph</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>from</code></td>
<td>
<p>the node from which all paths will be
determined.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>to</code></td>
<td>
<p>the node to which all paths will be
determined.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>shortest_path</code></td>
<td>
<p>an option to return paths that
are the shortest in the set of all determined paths.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>longest_path</code></td>
<td>
<p>an option to return paths that
are the longest in the set of all determined paths.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>distance</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of integer values that
specify which of the valid paths to return when
filtering by distance.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a list of paths, sorted by ascending
traversal length, comprising vectors of node IDs in
sequence of traversal through the graph.
</p>
