<h2>Delete an edge from an existing graph object</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>From a graph object of class
<code>dgr_graph</code>, delete an existing edge by
specifying either: (1) a pair of node IDs
corresponding to the edge (keeping into
consideration the direction of the edge in
a directed graph), or (2) an edge ID.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
delete_edge(graph, from = NULL, to = NULL, id = NULL)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>a graph object of class
<code>dgr_graph</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>from</code></td>
<td>
<p>a node ID from which the edge to be
removed is outgoing. If an edge ID is provided to
<code>id</code>, then this argument is ignored. There
is the option to use a node <code>label</code>
value here (and this must correspondingly also be
done for the <code>to</code> argument) for defining
node connections. Note that this is only possible
if all nodes have distinct <code>label</code> values set
and none exist as an empty string.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>to</code></td>
<td>
<p>a node ID to which the edge to be removed
is incoming. If an edge ID is provided to
<code>id</code>, then this argument is ignored. There
is the option to use a node <code>label</code>
value here (and this must correspondingly also be
for the <code>from</code> argument) for defining
node connections. Note that this is only possible
if all nodes have distinct <code>label</code> values set
and none exist as an empty string.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>id</code></td>

<p>an edge ID of the edge to be removed.</p>
