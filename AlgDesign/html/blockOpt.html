<h2>Optimal design blocking</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Blocking of experimental designs using various criteria.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>

optBlock(frml,withinData,blocksizes,rows=NULL,wholeBlockData=NULL,center=FALSE,
	nRepeats=5,criterion="D",args=FALSE)

</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>frml</code></td>
<td>
<p>This may be omitted if <code>data</code> is the fully model expanded candidate list.
If present it should be a formula starting with <code>~</code> which describes the model using
variable names from <code>data</code>. It may be <code>~</code>. if all variables from <code>data</code> are to be 
used linearly. It may also be <i>~.^p</i>, where p is an integer. In addition to the usual 
operators, quad(), cubic() and cubicS() may be used to expand variables from <code>data</code> 
into polynomial models.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>withinData</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix or data.frame describing the variables. If the columns are not 
named, they will be assumed to have the names X1,X2, etc. Although data may be input as
global variables used in frml, it is preferable to input it here. The number of rows in <code>withinData</code>
must be at least as large as the sum of the number of terms plus the number of blocks.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>blocksizes</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector giving the block sizes for each block. The length of <code>blocksizes</code>
specifies the number of blocks.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>rows</code></td>
<td>
<p>Row numbers (not rownames) of withinData rows to be used as a starting blocked design.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>wholeBlockData</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix or data.frame describing the whole block variables. The number of
rows should equal the length of blocksizes. Each row should
correspond to the settings of the whole block variable in a block.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>center</code></td>
<td>
<p>If TRUE, the withinData and wholeBlockData will be centered.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>nRepeats</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of times the entire process is repeated.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>criterion</code></td>
<td>
<p>&quot;D&quot;:D-criterion: &quot;OB&quot;,&quot;OBS&quot;: orthogonal blocks, unscaled and scaled; &quot;Dp&quot;,&quot;Dpc&quot;: 
Product of block determinants, uncentered and centered.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>args</code></td>
<td>
<p>If TRUE, the actual arguments to the function including the starting random number
seed should be output.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Cook and Nachtsheim (1989) developed a blocking algorithm using the D criterion, which not only finds blocks, but attempts to optimize the design itself. The package Dopt, converted by V.N. Venables, implements this technology &ndash; unfortunately there seem to be bugs in the FORTRAN code. 
</p>
<p>This function uses various criteria to block either pre-existing designs or to creates a new blocked design from a candidate list. There may be interactions between whole plot and within plot factors, and it may be used to produce multistratum blocked designs. 
</p>
<p>The algebraic expressions used here for the D criterion are quite different than those used by either Cook and Nachtshim or Goos and Vandebroek. They are described in <em>Comments on algorithmic design</em>, a paper accompanying this package.
</p>
<p>Although the D criterion produces good designs for all blocks, the allocation for individual blocks can often be improved upon by the use of either the Dp or Dpc criterion, which optimize the product of the determinants of the individual blocks. The Dp criterion uses uncentered blocks, the Dpc uses centered blocks. 
</p>
<p>Blocking may also be done using the orthogonal blocking procedure of Nguyen. This comes in two flavors OB and OBS which differ in that for OBS, the columns of S are scaled by division with the sample variance of the data, thus deemphasizing squared and other large terms.
</p>
<p>Blocking may be done when whole plot factors interact with within plot factors. Split plot experiments are sometimes of this nature. Goos and Vandebroek (2003) developed a procedure for this problem which algorithmically blocks using a candidate list and the ratio between the whole and within variances. Trinca and Gilmour (2001) give an algorithm which does not depend on the ratio of the variances. The present procedure assumes that the whole blocks and their factors, have been decided upon in advance. It makes no assumptions about the ratio between whole and within variances.
