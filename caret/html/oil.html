<h2>Fatty acid composition of commercial oils</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Fatty acid concentrations of commercial oils were measured using gas
chromatography.  The data is used to predict the type of oil.  Note that
only the known oils are in the data set. Also, the authors state that there
are 95 samples of known oils. However, we count 96 in Table 1 (pgs.  33-35).

<tr valign="top"><td><code>fattyAcids</code></td>
<td>
<p>data frame of fatty acid compositions: Palmitic,
Stearic, Oleic, Linoleic, Linolenic, Eicosanoic and Eicosenoic. When values
fell below the lower limit of the assay (denoted as &lt;X in the paper), the
limit was used. </p>
