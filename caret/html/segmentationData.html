<h2>Cell Body Segmentation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Hill, LaPan, Li and Haney (2007) develop models to predict which cells in a
high content screen were well segmented.  The data consists of 119 imaging
measurements on 2019. The original analysis used 1009 for training and 1010
as a test set (see the column called <code>Case</code>).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The outcome class is contained in a factor variable called <code>Class</code> with
levels &quot;PS&quot; for poorly segmented and &quot;WS&quot; for well segmented.
</p>
<p>The raw data used in the paper can be found at the Biomedcentral website.
Versions of caret &lt; 4.98 contained the original data. The version now
contained in <code>segmentationData</code> is modified. First, several discrete
versions of some of the predictors (with the suffix &quot;Status&quot;) were removed.
Second, there are several skewed predictors with minimum values of zero
(that would benefit from some transformation, such as the log). A constant
value of 1 was added to these fields: <code>AvgIntenCh2</code>,
<code>FiberAlign2Ch3</code>, <code>FiberAlign2Ch4</code>, <code>SpotFiberCountCh4</code> and
<code>TotalIntenCh2</code>.
