`htmltidy` â€” Clean up gnarly HTML/XML

Inspired by [this SO question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37061873/identify-a-weblink-in-bold-in-r) and because there's a great deal of cruddy HTML out there that needs fixing to use properly when scraping data.

NOTE: Requires [`libtidy`](http://www.html-tidy.org/) and presently is super-basic (no way to set options and pretty much only does HTML)

You'll need to first do a `brew install tidy-html5` on MacOS or `apt-get install libtidy-dev` on Ubuntu/Debian to get this to work. NOTE that the linux libraries may be older and return slightly different (but no less tidy) HTML.

**SEEKING COLLABORATORS**

This works enough for me to use in a pinch. It should be straightforward (but tedious) to:

- enable passing options in a `list`
- bundle `libtidy` _with the package_ and get it to work on Windows, linux & MacOS as the library compiles on all three with the necessary tools.

The following functions are implemented:
