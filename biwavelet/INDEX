MOTHERS                 Supported mother wavelets
ar1.spectrum            Power spectrum of a random red noise process
ar1_ma0_sim             Slightly faster 'arima.sim' implementation
                        which assumes AR(1) and 'ma=0'.
arrow                   Helper function for 'phase.plot' (not exported)
arrow2                  This is an alternative helper function that
                        plots arrows. It uses 'text()' to print a
                        character using a default font. This way, it is
                        possible to render different types of arrows.
