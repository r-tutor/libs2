<h2>Support for Item Hierarchies</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Often an item hierarchy is available for datasets used for 
association rule mining. For example in a supermarket dataset
items like  &quot;bread&quot; and &quot;beagle&quot; might belong to the item
group (category) &quot;baked goods.&quot; 
</p>
<p>We provide support to use the item hierarchy to aggregate items 
to different group levels, to
produce multi-level transactions and to filter spurious    
associations mined from multi-level transactions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
## S4 method for signature 'itemMatrix'
aggregate(x, by)
## S4 method for signature 'itemsets'
aggregate(x, by)
## S4 method for signature 'rules'
aggregate(x, by)
addAggregate(x, by, postfix = "*")
filterAggregate(x)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>an transactions, itemsets or rules object.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>by</code></td>
<td>
<p>name of a field (hierarchy level) available in 
itemInfo or a vector of 
character strings (factor) of the same length as items in <code>x</code>
by which should be aggregated. Items receiving
the same label in <code>by</code> will be aggregated into a single,
higher-level item.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>postfix</code></td>
<td>
<p>characters added to mark group-level items.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

  
<p>Transactions can store item hierarchies as additional columns in the 
itemInfo data.frame (<code>"labels"</code> is reserved for the item labels). 
</p>
<p><b>Aggregation:</b> To perform analysis at a group level of the item hierarchy,
<code>aggregate()</code> produces a new
object with items aggregated to a given group level. A group-level item
is present if one or more of the items in the group are present in 
the original object.
If rules are aggregated, and the 
aggregation would lead to the same aggregated group item in the lhs and 
in the rhs, then that group item is removed from the lhs. 
Rules or itemsets, which are not     
unique after the aggregation, are also removed. Note also that the 
quality measures are not applicable to the new rules and thus are removed. 
If these measures are required, then aggregate the transactions before 
mining rules.
</p>
<p><b>Multi-level analysis:</b> To analyze relationships between 
individual items 
and item groups, <code>addAggregate()</code> creates a new transactions object
which contains both, the original items and group-level items (marked with
a given postfix). In association rule mining, all items are handled 
the same, which means that we will produce a large number of rules
of the type 
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>item A =&gt; group of item A</i></p>

<p>with a confidence of 1. This happens also to itemsets 
<code>filterAggregate()</code> can be used to
filter these spurious rules or itemsets.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>aggregate()</code> returns an object of the same class as <code>x</code> encoded
with a number of items equal to the number of unique values in
<code>by</code>. Note that for associations (itemsets and rules) 
the number of associations in the 
returned set will most likely be reduced since
several associations might map to the same aggregated association and
aggregate returns a unique set. If several associations map to
a single aggregated association then the quality measures of one 
of the original associations is randomly chosen.
</p>
<p><code>addAggregate()</code> returns a new transactions object with the
original items and the group-items added. <code>filterAggregateRules()</code>
returns a new rules object with the spurious rules remove.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
data("Groceries")
Groceries
  
## Groceries contains a hierarchy stored in itemInfo
head(itemInfo(Groceries))

## aggregate by level2: items will become labels at level2
## Note that the number of items is therefore reduced to 55
Groceries_level2 &lt;- aggregate(Groceries, by = "level2")
Groceries_level2
head(itemInfo(Groceries_level2)) ## labels are alphabetically sorted!


## compare orginal and aggregated transactions
inspect(head(Groceries, 2))
inspect(head(Groceries_level2, 2))

## create lables manually (organize items by the first letter)
mylevels &lt;- toupper(substr(itemLabels(Groceries), 1, 1))
head(mylevels)

Groceries_alpha &lt;- aggregate(Groceries, by = mylevels)
Groceries_alpha
inspect(head(Groceries_alpha, 2))

## aggregate rules 
## Note: you could also directly mine rules from aggregated transactions to
## get support, lift and support
rules &lt;- apriori(Groceries, parameter=list(supp=0.005, conf=0.5))
rules
inspect(rules[1])

rules_level2 &lt;- aggregate(rules, by = "level2")
inspect(rules_level2[1])

## mine multi-level rules:
## (1) add aggregate items. These items are followed by a *
Groceries_multilevel &lt;- addAggregate(Groceries, "level2")
summary(Groceries_multilevel)
inspect(head(Groceries_multilevel))

rules &lt;- apriori(Groceries_multilevel, 
  parameter = list(support = 0.01, conf = .9))
inspect(head(rules, by = "lift"))
## this contains many spurous rules of type 'item X =&gt; aggregare of item X'
## with a confidence of 1 and high lift.

## filter spurious rules resulting from the aggregation 
rules &lt;- filterAggregate(rules)
inspect(head(rules, by = "lift"))
