<h2>Rule Induction from Itemsets</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Provides the generic function and the needed S4 method to
induce all rules which can be generated by the given set of itemsets
from a transactions dataset. This method can be used to create
closed association rules.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
ruleInduction(x, ...)
## S4 method for signature 'itemsets'
ruleInduction(x, transactions, confidence = 0.8, 
    control = NULL)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p> the set of itemsets from which rules will be induced. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p> further arguments. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>transactions</code></td>
<td>
<p> the transaction dataset used to mine 
the itemsets. Can be omitted if <code>x</code> contains a lattice 
(complete set) of frequent itemsets together with their support counts. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>confidence</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric value giving the minimum confidence for the
rules. </p>
</td></tr>  
<tr valign="top"><td><code>control</code></td>
<td>
<p>a named list with elements
<code>method</code> indicating the method (<code>"apriori"</code> or <code>"ptree"</code>),
and the logical arguments <code>reduce</code> and
<code>verbose</code> to indicate if unused items are removed and if
the output should be verbose.
Currently,  <code>"ptree"</code> is the default method.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If in control <code>method = "apriori"</code> is used, a very simple rule
induction method is used. All rules are mined from the transactions
data set using Apriori with the minimal support found in itemsets.
And in a second step all rules which do not stem from one of the
itemsets are removed. This procedure will be in many cases very slow
(e.g., for itemsets with many elements or very low support).
</p>
<p>If in control <code>method = "ptree"</code> is used, the transactions are
counted into a prefix tree and then the rules are selectively generated
using the counts in the tree. This is usually faster than the above
approach.
</p>
<p>If in control <code>reduce = TRUE</code> is used, unused items are removed
from the data before creating rules. This might be slower for large
transaction data sets. However, for <code>method = "ptree"</code> this is
highly recommended as the items are further reordered to reduce the
counting time.
</p>
<p>If argument <code>transactions</code> is missing it is assumed that <code>x</code>
contains a lattice (complete set) of frequent itemsets together with 
their support counts. Then rules can be induced directly without 
support counting. This approach is very fast.
</p>
<p>For <code>transactions</code>, a set different to the data used for creating the
original itemsets can be used, however, the new set has to conform in terms 
of items and their order.
</p>
<p>This method can be used to produce closed association rules defined by
Pei et al. (2000) as rules <i>X -&gt; Y</i> where both <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>
are closed frequent itemsets. See Example section for code.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
data("Adult")

## find all closed frequent itemsets
closed_is &lt;- apriori(Adult, 
	parameter = list(target = "closed frequent itemsets", support = 0.4))
closed_is

## use rule induction to produce all closed association rules
closed_rules &lt;- ruleInduction(closed_is, Adult, 
  control = list(verbose = TRUE))

## X&amp;Y are already closed, check that X is also closed
closed_rules[is.element(lhs(closed_rules), items(closed_is))]

## inspect the resulting closed rules
summary(closed_rules)
inspect(head(closed_rules, by = "lift"))

## use lattice of frequent itemsets
ec  &lt;- eclat(Adult, parameter = list(support = 0.4))
rec &lt;- ruleInduction(ec)
rec
inspect(head(rec))
