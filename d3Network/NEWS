## v0.5.2.1 

Trivial change to deal with deficiency in CRAN Markdown processor.

## v0.5.2

Fixed a bug in `d3Sankey` that prevented the `parentElement` from being 
customisable selected. Thanks to Bo Werth for identifying this.

## v0.5.1

Added `linkWidth` to `d3ForceNetwork` in order to set the link width. An
absolute numeric width can be set as well as a JavaScript function for weighting
by `Value`.

Improved documentation to demonstrate how a JavaScript function can be added to
`linkDistance`, possibly to weight the distance by `Value`.

Thanks to Kevin Keenan for the suggestion.

Improvements to `iframe` width/height calculation for `d3SimpleNetwork`.

Removed 'TWh' from `d3Sankey`'s number format. 
Thanks to Enzo Martoglio for spotting this. 

Documentation improvements.

## v0.5

`parentElement` argument added to all d3Network functions. It allows the user
to specify the resulting svg graph's parent element. This is especially handy
for use with Shiny server. Thanks to John Harrison.

Minor documentation improvements.

Internal code cleaning.

## v0.4.2

Minor bug fix for `d3ForceNetwork`.

## v0.4.1

Improve `d3ForceNetwork` documentation.

## v0.4

Added `d3Sankey` to create Sankey diagrams. Thanks to Scott Chamberlain for the
suggestion.

## v0.3.3

`toJSONarray` no longer quotes integers. Thanks to Mark Gene.

## v0.3.2

Change examples for `d3ClusterDendro` so that they run on Windows.

## v0.3.1

Collapse and expand clustered dendrograms.

Mouse over zooming with clustered dendrograms.

## v0.3

Added Reingoldâ€“Tilford Tree graph with `d3Tree`.

Added Cluster Denograms with `d3ClusterDendro`.

## v0.2.1

Added ability to zoom into and out of graphs with `zoom` option for
`d3ForceNetwork`.

`d3ForceNetwork` example now uses tabular data.

## v0.2

Added `d3ForceNetwork` for creating force directed network graphs where link
distance and group changes the graphs attributes.

`d3SimpleNetwork` and `d3Network` are now the same and have improved aesthetic
customisability. `d3Network` is depricated. This is in advance of creating
functions for force directed and other types of networks.

`JSONtoDF` command added for reading a JSON data file into R. It converts a
specified array in the JSON data  into a data frame.

Improvements to the internal workings of the commands. Now uses mustache
templates to create the graphs.

Documentation and minor bug fixes.

## v0.1.2

Internal improvements using whisker templating.
