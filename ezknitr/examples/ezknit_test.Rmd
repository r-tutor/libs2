Time: `r date()`

Where am I? My working directory is:

`r getwd()`


I like to assume the directory containing the 'R' and 'data' folders is the
working directory.  Let's try to read a file from the 'data' folder.

```{r }
dat <- scan("data/numbers.txt", quiet = TRUE)
```

How many numbers were read from the input?

```{r }
length(dat)
```

(If you see errors when using `knitr`, that's expected - it's because the
working directory was not what the script assumed.)

```{r setparam, echo = FALSE}
ezknitr::set_default_params(list(numPoints = 15))
```

Here's a plot of `r numPoints` random points:

```{r plot, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(100)
plot(rnorm(numPoints))
```
