Changes since version 0.6.1
----------------------------
* Updated author and maintainer details

Changes since version 0.5.8
----------------------------
* Removed dependence of print.glm on print.glm. Instead the generic method is called (thanks to Brian Ripley for contacting me on this).

Changes since version 0.5.7
----------------------------
* Implemented a fix for correctly resetting the "warn" option value to what the user has set prior to the execution of brglm.fit (thanks to Kurt Hornik for contacting me on this)
* Implemented a fix to avoid a warning related to the binding of n which is evaluated by family$initialize in brglm.fit (thanks to Kurt Hornik for contacting me on this)

Changes since version 0.5.6
----------------------------
* Minor changes in example(modifications) to avoid the use of .Call in the functions therein (thanks to Brian Ripley for contacting me on this).
* Updated contact information

Changes since version 0.5.5
----------------------------
* Added the br.consts argument to brglm.control which offers some handling of the starting values to the brglm.fit iteration.
* Updated contact and citation information.

Changes since version 0.5.4
----------------------------
* Improved constant adjustments for starting the fitting procedure in brglm.fit.
* Updated the references to papers in the help files.

Changes since version 0.5.3
----------------------------
* Minor corrections to the help files.
* The reported AIC, was incorrect, due to a minor bug. This is now corrected.
* Minor modifications to the separation.detection function
* Due to a bug, brglm was mishandling observations with zero weight. This is now corrected.
* Some improvements to profile and confint methods for brglm objects.
* Added citation file.


Changes since version 0.5.2
----------------------------
*	Corrected a bug in brglm that could cause division by zero while scaling the design matrix.
*	Due to a bug, brglm.fit was producing errors with model fits containing more that one aliased out parameters. This is now corrected (thanks to Aleks Jakulin for spotting the issue).
*	Corrected a bug, that could affect the predict methods when aliased out parameters appeared (thanks to Aleks Jakulin for spotting the issue).

Changes since version 0.5-1:
----------------------------
*	Correction of typos (sorry!) and various improvements of the help files.
